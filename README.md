# KPI_BigData

## How to start (on windows):
#### 1) Dowload from official site hadoop 3.0.0 and unzip it for C:\BigData\hadoop-3.0.0 folder or any other
#### 2) Delete "bin" and "etc" folder from hadoop folder
#### 3) Go to "_dependencies/hadoop-3.0.0" in this repo and take "bin" and "etc" folder for hadoop (copy them to hadoop folder)
2 and 3 steps required because you need windows build bin folder but in default build from official site you can only take for UNIX. Folder "etc" contains required configs.
